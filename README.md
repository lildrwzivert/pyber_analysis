Analysis of ride-share data of different populated region types over several months. 

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project was to use Pandas and MatPlotLib to analyze rideshare data and create a chart of data presenting weekly trends in urban, suburban, and rural regions, from January to April of 2019, comparing the change in fare on a weekly basis. 

## Results:

The total number of drivers and rides was lowest in the rural areas at 125 total rides and 78 drivers. Suburban areas had 625 rides with 490 drivers, and urban areas had 1625 rides with 2405 drivers. Rural areas had the highest average fares per driver (~$55) and per ride (~$34), followed by surbuban and urban areas.  The rural area's combined total fares was $4327.93 compared to the suburb's $19,356.33 total and urban area's $39,854.38.  The higher average for rural areas was outweighed by the total number of rides for both suburban and urban areas. Fare count was highest in the final weeks of February and lowest in the first week of January. Difference in total fares accumulated was most sensitive to change in urban areas and least sensitive in rural areas. 


## Summary:

Recommendation 1: Incentivize redistribution of urban drivers to rural and suburban markets. Urban area has more drivers than rides taken.
Recommendation 2: Offer promotions to riders at peak windows (like end of February).
Recommendation 3: Increase driver bonuses during slow business windows (like beginning of January).
